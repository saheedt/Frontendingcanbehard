# Frontendingcanbehard
A simple movie searcher application that touches on the basics on frontend development.
This application was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) but focuses on HTML and CSS.
In this project I tried to achieve the following:
* Responsive UI by targeting three major device categories (Phone, Tablet and PC)
* Usage of Semantic HTML
* Making the application as accessible as possible.

## Deployed Application
